---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Grainy sauce:** Lower heat; add a splash of cream and whisk. Melt cheese off direct heat.
- **Thin sauce:** Simmer 2–3 minutes to reduce, or whisk in 1 tsp cornstarch slurry.
- **Dry baked mac:** Stir in 1/2 cup warm milk before topping and baking.
- **Clumpy cheese:** Add cheese gradually with constant stirring; keep below a simmer.

### Pro Tips for Perfect Mac and Cheese

1. **Don't overcook pasta:** Cook 1–2 minutes less than package directions—it continues cooking in the sauce
2. **Room temperature cheese:** Cold cheese can break the sauce; let it warm slightly
3. **Low and slow:** Add cheese off heat or on very low heat to prevent separation
4. **Reserve pasta water:** Save 1 cup—it's liquid gold for adjusting sauce consistency
5. **Season boldly:** Cheese dulls seasoning, so don't be shy with salt and pepper
6. **Toast breadcrumbs:** Mix with melted butter before topping for extra crunch
